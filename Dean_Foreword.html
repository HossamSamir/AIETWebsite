                    <div class="desc">Welcome to the Alexandria Higher Institute of Engineering & Technology (AIET). Let us tell you a little bit about this remarkable AIET Institute. AIET is a private Institute owned by "Mohamed-Ragab Foundation for Social Development" which is a non-profit organization registered under No. SR 1075 with the Egyptian Government. The study in the AIET Institute started in the 1997-1998 academic year.
The motivation behind establishing this private AIET Institute is to fulfill the industry needs in Egypt for engineers well-educated and trained in modern engineering and technological fields. The study in the AIET Institute is in favor not only of the Engineering aspects but also of the Technical aspects with concentration not only on theoretical bases but also on laboratory work, so that the graduates would be qualified to start working in their jobs without lack of theory and without much job training.</div>
                </div>

                <div class="desc">
                  It gives me great pleasure to announce that the Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) Engineering Programs offered by the AIET Institute, namely:

                  have been approved (by the decree # 3 on Feb 5, 2002  and renewed by the Decree # 100 on June 17,  2007) by the Supreme Council of Egyptian Universities to be equivalent to corresponding programs offered by the Egyptian Government Universities. This has been applied to our graduates starting with those who have graduated in 2002. This approval gives our graduates the privileges:1) to enroll in postgraduate studies (Higher Diplomas, Master, and Ph. D. Degrees) in Egyptian Government or Private Universities, 2) to join the Army and Police as Engineer officers, and 3) to apply for membership in the Egyptian Engineering Syndicate. In brief, AIET graduates have the same rights, duties, and obligations as the engineering graduates of any reputable university in Egypt!

                <div class="desc">
                  <b>The AIET Institute has celebrated the first graduating class in 2002 since its establishment in 1997.</b> The graduates have been offered the B.Sc. degree in Electronics and Communications Engineering. The first graduating classes in Computer Engineering and Mechatronics Engineering were in 2003 and 2004, respectively.

                  had started in the academic year 2007-2008. The AIET Institute has provided all necessary steps and facilities to start this new vital program: Space-wise, staff-wise, laboratory-wise, and approval-wise. This new promising IE program is approved by the Minister of Higher Education, decree # 1323 on Oct 24, 1999 and decree # 25 on Jan 9, 2002; The Accreditation of the Supreme Council of Egyptian Universities will be applied for one year from now (during the academic year 2010-2011). We invite students passing successfully the Preparatory year to join this promising Program.

                <div class="desc">
                  Major expansions and additions have taken place during the last few academic years. A five-floor new building is added to the AIET Institute buildings; it encompasses most of the facilities of the Mechatronics Engineering and Industrial Engineering Programs in addition to the Library, high administration offices, and roof cafeteria, gymnasium, and athletic fields. The workshop building has been expanded, reconditioned, and reequipped. The name of the Institute has been expanded to reflect its engineering aspect: The Institute name became <b>"Alexandria Higher Institute of Engineering & Technology (AIET)</b> instead of the old one <b>"Alexandria Institute of Technology (AIT).</b> The AIET had applied to fully use credit hour system. A plenty of academic staff had joined the AIET Institute in addition to tens of teaching assistants and assistant-lecturers. Five Lab Engineers were fulltime-appointed to take care of recently added sophisticated labs. The Continuing Education & Training Department (CETD) is reactivated by sharing in ICDL countrywide program as a UNISCO-certified training & testing center. CETD has a Microsoft IT Academy, a Cisco Networking Academy, and a Prometric Testing Center. CETD is also a TOEFL International IBT.

                  Dear Student,The AIET Institute is well-equipped with more than 32 up-to-date laboratories and with state-of-the-art experimental set-ups interfaced with computers to meet your challenge and to the envy of our sister Institutions. Needless to say, the AIET Institute is well equipped with computer facilities. The laboratories and computer facilities are under your disposal outside the laboratory hours to satisfy your needs for more practicing. You will acquire hands-on technical skills that enable you to solve problems you would meet in your future job. Competent faculty members teach at the AIET Institute. We are familiar with your dreams and aspirations, and we are dedicated to helping you get to where you want to be.

                  <br><br> 

<b>What is Engineering Technology?</b>
The following definition of engineering technology was established by the Technology Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) and approved by the Engineering Technology Council of the American Society for Engineering Education: "Engineering technology is the profession in which a knowledge of mathematics and natural sciences gained by higher education, experience, and practice is devoted primarily to the implementation and extension of existing technology for the benefit of humanity".
<br><br>
Engineering technology education focuses primarily on the applied aspects of science and engineering aimed at preparing graduates for practice in that portion of engineering and technology spectrum closest to product improvement, manufacturing, construction, and engineering operational functions. Thus engineering technology is the application of engineering principles and modern technology to help solve or prevent technical problems. We, at the Alexandria Higher Institute of Engineering & Technology (AIET), are teaching tomorrow's Engineers & Technologists today.
<br><br>
Professional training is a vital component of an engineer's education. We believe in the integration of academic study and professional training. This is achieved by spending six weeks each summer in industry during your stay at the AIET Institute. Through its contacts with the industries in Egypt, and in Alexandria in particular, the AIET Institute will find these training positions for its students. Also the AIET Institute will get some training positions for its students in industries abroad. The professional training program will help the students to find a suitable employment upon graduation
<br><br>
The AIET Institute considers the proper placement of its graduates to be very important, and it is recognized that the first years of professional experience are of great significance in developing the full capabilities of the young engineer. For these reasons the AIET Institute provides an engineering placement service for students. This service includes the announcement of openings received by mail, and the providing of placement information through counseling and published material.
It is of course, important to set aside time for social and leisure activities. For those keen on sports, the AIET Institute has access to a new state-of-the-art sport and recreation facility, includes a multipurpose gymnasium with basketball, volleyball, and handball courts. It houses a swimming pool, squash and tennis courts. We have activities in Arts (music, visual art, drama, etc.).
At AIET, students are the most important people in the Institution. All of us at AIET exists to serve them, and through them to serve the community and nation. As a student at AIET, you can look forward to playing an important part in tomorrow's world.
At AIET, we are striving by <b>"Teaching, Educating, and Training"</b> to make AIET deserving its name.
Before ending this word, we like to appreciate the tremendous effort done along years by the owner of AIET Institute, Mr Mohamed A. Ragab, President of Ragab Group, and by the Founding Dean, Prof Dr Mahmoud M. Shabana. With such devotion and high quality effort AIET became a reality.
<br><br><br><br>
