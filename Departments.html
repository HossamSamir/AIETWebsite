        <p>Electronics and communications Engineering is a broad professional discipline concerned with the analysis, design and management of electronic circuitry, voice, data and video systems. The complexity of modern industrial and service organizations with their emphasis on quality, increased effectiveness and higher productivity through automation and computerization has led to an increased demand for a new bread of electronics and communications engineering graduates.</p>
        <b style='color: red;'>The Role of Electronics and Communications Engineers...</b>

        <p>
        Engineers are builders, doers, and decision-makers. Today's Electronics and Communications Engineers are those who understand the design/make/ inspect/manage electronics and communications systems that generate, transmit, and utilize signals. They draw upon the knowledge of mathematics, physical and technical engineering sciences to function as problem solvers, innovators, designers, coordinators and system integrators.

        Electronics and Communications Engineers practice in all phases of electronics and communications industries and government agencies. They design and coordinate the design of man-machined systems, computer controlled systems.
        </p>

        <b style="color: red;">Vision</b><br>
        <p>The department seeks to graduate engineers scientifically distinct them the ability to participate in the areas of electronics and communications engineering, depending on the education of high quality compatible with regional and international standards .</p>

        <b style="color: red;">Mission</b><br>
        <p> 
        This department aims to provide high-quality education in the field of electronic and communications engineering in order to enhance the competitiveness of graduates in the labor market and contribute to economic development and relevant scientific specialization by maintaining a positive environment academic excellence in teaching, learning and scientific research, which creates a constructive interaction between students and academic members as well as industrial society where the available resources of the technical knowledge and research capacity are used to encourage the thinking and the development of mental skills as well as developing communication skills.</p>

        <p>Computers praliferate all areas of activity in our life. Nowadays government departments and industrial firms as well as universities and bussiness establishments not can do without computers . In view of the novelty of computer technologies and the multitude of their attendant problems, there emerged a desperate need for national specialists and qualified personnel who can cope with the tremendous rate of computer technology development, and contribute positively to the solution of problems hindering the optimum use of such technologies in different areas.

        Based on the objectives of AIT in qualifying specialists in technological and engineering field, and in response to the increasing demands for computer engineering, it was natural , to establish a computer engineering department within the institute.</p>
        <b style='color: red;'>Department Objectives.</b>

        <p>
        The computer engineering department manages and conducts all activities regarding course work, lab experiments, and hands-on computer sessions in the area of computer engineering at large. This ranges from specialized short courses to 5 years computer engineering program. The department is supported with a wide range of well equipped computer labs and facilities to allow providing about 50% of study time to hands-on experiaence.

        In order to accomplish the aforementioned objectives, the computer engineering department offers the following:
        <ul>
          <li>B. Sc. in computer Engineering.</li>
          <li>Training and consultation.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <b style='color: red;'>Graduate Opportunities</b>
        <p>The responsibilities of the graduate of the computer engineering department encompass specifying the most suitable computer equipment for a certain function, offering expert opinion and consultations in the field, supervising computer installations and operation, planning their sites and environments and design and implementation of software packages.</p>

        <b style="color: red;">Vision</b><br>
        <p> 
        The Department aims to provide a significant educational level, dependent on the national and international academic standards, to contribute in various Computer Engineering fields, scientific research and community services.
        </p>

        <b style="color: red;">Mission</b><br>
        <p>   
        The Department seeks to graduate qualified engineers through a distinct educational program in the field of Computer Engineering to meet the requirements of the labor market, adapt to rapid changes in the fields of science, research and technology and contribute to the development of society and the surrounding environment.

        <p>The new Department opened in 2001 The recommendation was based on a thorough market survey. The objective has been to establish a strong program in a much-needed specialization that would complement rather than duplicate the offerings of the national universit.

In reality, most of Mechanical Engineering programs of study are oriented towards producing design engineering in the various sub-areas of Mechanical Engineering. However the Mechatronics Engineering program is directed to foster technology advances in the industry, equipment and methods, project level controls and management.

The program is expected to fill the gap between design oriented education of Mechanical Engineering programs and industry. This gap has been a major concern of the International Organizations who are involved in Mechanical Engineering in Egypt, as well as Arab and African countries</p>
        <b style='color: red;'>The Role of Mechatronics Engineers</b>

        <p>
        TMechatronics Engineers play a major role in energy utilization and conservation, in solar energy, design and selection, management, operation and maintenance of both conventional and non-conventional power plants, heating, air conditioning and refrigeration, transportation and automotive fields, and in the fields of automation, fluid machinery, production and processing machinery including the petroleum and chemical fields.

        <p> 
The department aims to graduate engineers scientifically distinct to be able to participate in the area of Mechatronics Engineering depending on the high quality education in conformity with the local and international standards that contribute to community service.</p>

        <b style="color: red;">Mission</b><br>
        <p> 
          
The department aims to graduated generations of engineers in the field of engineering mechatronics to participate in more than one area of work in factories and public and private companies through the application of technological progress and scientific research methods on many of the equipment and controls the level of projects and management for serving the industrial society, and help in the design of mechanical engineering and the wise use of energy as well as managing, operation, maintenance of integrated systems that contribute to community service.</p>
